# SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction 🚀

## Project Overview
This project is part of the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Capstone**. As a Data Scientist working for the startup **Space Y**, my goal is to compete with SpaceX by predicting the success of their rocket launches. 

SpaceX is able to offer lower prices ($62M) compared to other providers ($165M+) because they can reuse the first stage of their Falcon 9 rockets. By predicting if the first stage will land successfully, we can determine the cost of a launch.

## 🎯 Project Goals
* **Data Collection:** Retrieve data from SpaceX API and scrape Wikipedia.
* **EDA:** Perform exploratory data analysis using SQL and visualization tools.
* **Mapping:** Visualize launch sites and landing success using Folium maps.
* **Dashboarding:** Build an interactive dashboard with Plotly Dash.
* **Machine Learning:** Train and evaluate classification models to predict landing success.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
* **Languages:** Python 3.x
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Requests, BeautifulSoup (Web Scraping), Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium, Scikit-learn
* **Data Science Tools:** SQL (SQLite/IBM DB2), Jupyter Notebooks
* **Deployment:** Plotly Dash (Interactive Dashboard)
